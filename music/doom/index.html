		<p id="header">MF DOOM</p>
    <p id="normal">MF DOOM is a New York rapper and producer. MF DOOM broke out with his hit Operation Doomsday. An album that wears out its runtime within the first 10 songs. Some would say that DOOM would come into his element with Take Me to Your Leader by King Geedorah and Vaudeville Villain by Viktor Vaughn, the latter to which I would consider one of DOOM's greatest 3 projects. King Geedorah is a somewhat compilation album of many different turntable adjacent artists over Special Herbs-esque beats produced by DOOM. I find both of these albums extremely underwhelming when we're talking about DOOM, despite them being good projects. They start the whole pseudo-lore found in DOOM's music. The explanation for these are that King Geedorah controls and influences DOOM as a demi-god extraterrestrial, and Viktor Vaughn is simply a DOOM fan. These are boring and possibly the least you could do to add to the cartoony feel of DOOM's music. Then we have what may be considered the Magnum Opus of turntablism, Madvillainy by Madvillain. This album, despite having speed bumps, as all albums at this length do, is amazing. It's absolutely entertaining start to finish. It's certainly not the best DOOM-esque album, but it's still my favorite to listen to. </p> <br> <br>
		<p id="header"> MM.. FOOD</p>
		<p id="normal">DOOM's greatest album. MM.. FOOD is a 10/10 start to finish. The album starts with a cartoonish amalgamation to the tune of the coming bars. Beef Rapp is an extremely memorable anthem of food and rapping; essentially, the anthem of the following album. We then slide into Hoe Cakes, an upbeat song that follows the feeling of the prior. Potholderz, an entertaining song with Count Bass D. This slides into the charismatic beer song, One Beer. It adds to DOOM's character of alcoholism found in many of his songs. After Deep Friend Frenz a, surprisingly for DOOM, themed song. It talks about money and development of electronic's effects on the black community. After this, we are left with nothing but instrumentals until Kon Karne and Kon Queso play, both very average DOOM songs. After this, there is nothing important to the actual feel of the album. Not to downplay the lyrical genius that DOOM puts out on Vomitspit and Kookies, but they're rough patches on the album's whole theme.</p>
		<p id="normal">TL;DR</p>
		<p id="normal">If we've got to put it into a numerical value like this is some Anthony Fagtano outro, you can refer to the intro to this review, or just read the following: 10/10. Solid sound, absolute pleb filter. People who either don't listen to enough music or listen to too much completely lose sight of this amazing record.</p>
